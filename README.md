## Overview

This project is a full-stack supply chain management application that uses blockchain technology for transparency and security. It allows users to track the flow of products in the supply chain, verify authenticity, and maintain a tamper-proof ledger.

## Technologies Used

- **Web3.js**: Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the blockchain.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing transactional data.
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language for handling backend logic.
- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
- **QRious**: JavaScript library for generating QR codes.
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling language for designing web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for responsive web design.
- **Local Blockchain**: Used for development and testing (e.g., Grunt Ganache).
- **Grunt Ganache**: A tool for setting up a local Ethereum blockchain for testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DAPP-SupplyChain.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MySQL database and update the database configuration in `config.php`.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- **`contracts/`**: Smart contracts written in Solidity.
- **`migrations/`**: Ethereum contract migration scripts.
- **`public/`**: Static assets for the front-end (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **`src/`**: Node.js server code.
- **`templates/`**: PHP templates for rendering pages.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and scripts.

## Usage

1. Register and log in to the application.
2. Create products and assign them to the supply chain.
3. Use QR codes generated by the application for product verification.
4. View the supply chain history and ensure the integrity of the data.
